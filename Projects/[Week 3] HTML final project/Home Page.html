            <br>
            <p>My name is Venera Musliu and I live in Gjilan with my family, I also have a child who is two years old. 
                Iam an IT teacher and I actually work in a primary school in a village in the city of Gjilan. 
                <br>Venera teacher's day starts early with classes whose impact on both her students and the  field of education transcends classroom boundaries. 
                With seven years of experience in education and a background in computer science, she always attempt to bring a unique blend 
                 of theoretical knowledge and practical expertise to her role as an IT teacher.
                <br>
                Working with students is a blessing, regardless of the results of the children, which is not always satisfactory for us, 
                we should never give up on them, therefore we must always create an encouraging environment for them where questions 
                are encouraged and mistakes are seen like stepping stones to success.
                <br>
                At the moment I'm following the HTML, CSS and JavaScript Programming course at "Future Minds Academy" 
                where I'm really enjoying it and I'm hoping that in the very near future I'll be able to use this knowledge and work, why not even from home.
